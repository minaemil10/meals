# Meals üçΩÔ∏è
A Flutter-based recipe app that marks a milestone in my journey to master mobile development. Built with advanced layouts, Riverpod state management, and delightful animations.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Layouts**: Dynamic UI with `GridView`, `ListView`, and flexible `Row`/`Column` designs.
- **State Management**: Seamless filtering and favorites using Riverpod for robust global state handling.
- **Animations**: Intrinsic animations on category screens, extrinsic Hero transitions, and rotation effects for favorites.
